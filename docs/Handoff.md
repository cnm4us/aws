# Handoff Summary (Session: 2025-10-17)

## Current State
- Cookie-based sessions with `/api/me`, CSRF double-submit, and RBAC helper (`can()`) are live.
- Admin console (`/admin`) manages site settings, per-user overrides, invitations, members, and lists groups/channels.
- Slugs for personal/group/channel spaces are clean (no prefixes); routes `/members/:slug`, `/groups/:slug`, `/channels/:slug` respond with JSON.
- Space invitations table and member management endpoints are deployed.

## In-Flight / Suggestions
- Upcoming UX: channel/group approval workflow, verification-level limits, public landing for `/groups/:slug` and `/channels/:slug` (HTML view instead of raw JSON).
- Consider support for `/members/:slug` page (currently JSON only).
- Plan to document new endpoints (API.md / Security.md) in next session.

## Testing
- Manual smoke: create space via admin console, invite/remove members, approve session flows, CSRF-protected POST/DELETE routes.
- No automated tests added yet; consider adding integration tests around `/api/spaces`.
