<h1>Moderation &amp; Community Standards<br> A Quick Guide for Users</h1>

<p>Welcome to our platform.<br>
We’re here to support bold, creative expression — and a healthy, productive public space.<br>
This guide explains <em>how moderation works</em>, <em>how to flag content</em>, and <em>how to appeal decisions</em>, so that everyone knows exactly what to expect.</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. What Our Moderation System Is (and Isn’t)</h2>
<p>Moderation on our platform is designed to be:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Transparent</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Fair</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Documented</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Appealable</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Every moderation action must cite a <strong>specific rule</strong> from our published Community Guidelines.<br>
You will always know <em>what rule</em> applied and <em>why</em>.</p>

<p>We do <strong>not</strong> use secret rules or hidden enforcement.</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. What You Can Report</h2>
<p>You may report content that appears to violate the Community Guidelines, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Harassment or targeted abuse</li>
  <li>Hateful expressions based on identity</li>
  <li>Dangerous misinformation</li>
  <li>Explicit content in non-mature channels</li>
  <li>Illegal content</li>
  <li>Threats or incitement</li>
  <li>Spam or coordinated disruption</li>
</ul>
<p>When in doubt, check the <strong>Channel Rules</strong> — some channels allow “spicy,” satirical, or mature content, and others do not.</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. How Reporting Works</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Your report is logged</strong> (along with your credibility score).</li>
  <li><strong>The creator is notified</strong> and offered two options:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Concede</strong> the violation</li>
      <li><strong>Appeal</strong> the report</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>If they concede:</strong> The item is removed and the reporter receives a small reward.</li>
  <li><strong>If they appeal:</strong> A trained reviewer evaluates the item and issues a ruling based on the guidelines.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process discourages abuse, reduces false reports, and creates accountability on all sides.</p>

<hr>

<h2>4. Credibility Scores</h2>
<p>Every user has a <strong>Credibility Score</strong> that affects visibility and reach.</p>

<p>You <em>gain</em> credibility by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Posting guideline-compliant content</li>
  <li>Correctly flagging violations</li>
  <li>Participating constructively</li>
  <li>Accepting AI prompts to rephrase inflammatory comments</li>
  <li>Conceding when you make a mistake</li>
</ul>

<p>You may <em>lose</em> credibility if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You repeatedly make false reports</li>
  <li>You engage in coordinated mass-flagging</li>
  <li>Your content repeatedly violates guidelines</li>
  <li>You ignore AI warnings for severe language issues</li>
</ul>

<p>Higher credibility unlocks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wider reach</li>
  <li>Comment priority</li>
  <li>Channel recognition badges</li>
  <li>Access to advanced community tools</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>5. The Appeals Process</h2>
<p>If you receive a moderation action, you may:</p>

<h3>A. Accept the decision</h3>
<p>Your content is removed, and the case is closed.</p>

<h3>B. Appeal the moderation ruling</h3>
<p>A reviewer will examine:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The content</li>
  <li>The context</li>
  <li>The relevant guidelines</li>
  <li>Current channel rules</li>
</ul>

<p>Their decision will cite the <strong>exact rule</strong> applied.<br>
You will always receive a written explanation.</p>

<p>Repeated misuse of appeals (including frivolous appeals) may lower your credibility score.</p>

<hr>

<h2>6. AI Rephrase Assistant</h2>
<p>Before submitting a comment, you may see optional suggestions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“This sentence may be interpreted as harassment.”</li>
  <li>“Would you like to add context to avoid misinterpretation?”</li>
  <li>“Try softening this line to keep the conversation productive.”</li>
</ul>

<p>These are tools, not punishments.<br>
Using them improves your credibility and helps keep conversations meaningful.</p>

<hr>
