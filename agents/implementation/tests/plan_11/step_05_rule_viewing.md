# Step 05 — Rule viewing: API + SPA + historical HTML

Date: 2025-12-26

Goal:
- `/api/rules/:slug` returns `guidanceModeratorsHtml` and `guidanceAgentsHtml` only when `canViewGuidance` is true.
- `/rules/:slug/v:n` renders both guidance sections only when `canViewGuidance` is true.
- SPA `RuleView` renders both sections when present.
