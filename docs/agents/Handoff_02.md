# Handoff Summary (Session: 2025-10-19)

## Current State
- `/uploads` React page lists each upload with poster, metadata, and current publication targets. Uploading a new video via S3 presigned POST works end-to-end.
- `/productions` supports two views:
  * `/productions` → table of all productions for the current user with status + job metadata.
  * `/productions?upload=:uploadId` → per-upload workspace that shows the raw upload details, any existing productions, and a “Create Production” button.
  * `/productions?id=:productionId` → detail page for a single production (job info, config payload, publish shortcut).
- `/publish?id=:uploadId` UI lets members choose target spaces and uses the new publish/unpublish APIs.
- MediaConvert pipeline extracted to `startProductionRender` service; both `POST /api/productions` and `POST /api/publish` create a production row, update the upload, and launch the render job.
- Backend endpoints in place: `/api/uploads/:id/publish-options`, `/api/uploads/:id/publish`, `/api/uploads/:id/unpublish`, `/api/productions`, `/api/productions/:id`.

## In-Flight / Suggestions
- Wire MediaConvert job status updates back into `productions.status` (processing/completed/failed). Currently it stays `queued` until we hook existing job-tracking cron into productions.
- Integrate production config options (title page, lower thirds, audio) in `/productions?upload=…` once UX is ready; pass config into `startProductionRender`.
- Update `/publish` to display production-level context (selected production vs. raw upload) and enforce publishing only for completed productions.
- Consider surfacing production thumbnails/posters once HLS outputs arrive.
- Revisit chunk size warnings in Vite build (bundle > 500 KB) when time allows; optional code-splitting could help.

## Testing
- Manual flow: upload → create production → wait for MediaConvert output → publish to spaces. Works when the MediaConvert job completes successfully.
- No automated tests added yet.

- Frontend views: `frontend/src/app/Uploads.tsx`, `frontend/src/app/Productions.tsx`, `frontend/src/app/Publish.tsx`.
- DB schema updates in `src/db.ts` (added `productions` table & types).
